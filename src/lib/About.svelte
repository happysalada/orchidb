        Small and medium businesses (SMBs) represent more than 95% of businesses worldwide. Our extensive research highlights that most SMBs spend up to 60 days a year fiddling with bookkeeping, chasing invoices, reconciling spreadsheets, resetting passwords, settling tax claims, managing payroll, or sending financial statements to the authorities. Time is cash. Let’s think about this differently; when you buy or lease a car you don’t need to purchase an engine, the wheels,  or the gear stick separately. The car is integrated and takes you from A to B easily.
